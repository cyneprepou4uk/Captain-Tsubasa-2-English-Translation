# English Translation of Captain Tsubasa 2

Captain Tsubasa 2 [NES] disassembly. Most comments are in Russian.

Use `6502 syntax for notepad plus.xml` to highlight code in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).



## How to build

No special requirements. Just launch `assemble.bat` and wait until it's done.

Then open `_ct2.nes` to play the game (translation is not fully complete, yet).

Runs properly on [FCEUX](http://fceux.com/), [Mesen](https://www.mesen.ca/) and [Mednafen](https://mednafen.github.io/) (maybe some other emulators too).
